# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# E-Commerce Website

An **E-Commerce Website** that allows users to browse products by categories and subcategories, add items to the cart, and complete purchases. The application uses **React** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend, with a database (e.g., **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL**) to manage products, orders, and user information.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Product Categories & Subcategories**: Products are organized by categories and subcategories for easy browsing.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
- **Product Details**: Each product has detailed information, such as name, price, description, and images.
- **Order Management**: Users can view their order history and track orders.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
  - **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages (e.g., product pages, cart, etc.).
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to interact with the backend.
  - **Redux**: For state management, particularly for the shopping cart and user authentication.
  - **CSS/Styled-components**: For styling the components and making the site responsive.

- **Backend**:
  - **Django**: Web framework for building the backend API and managing database models.
  - **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: For building the RESTful API endpoints.
  - **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Relational databases for storing product, user, and order data.
  - **JWT Authentication**: For secure user authentication and session management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the E-Commerce website locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce.git


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
